# SubWallet
Web Applciation for users to enter in any expense that they deem fit. I got inspiration for the name from the subscriptions that everyone has nowadays instead of cable. 

The Technology that I used to produce such a product was c# and Entity Framwork Core for my backend AKA using an ORM. 

CSS (bootstrap framework) /HTML and one JS Library (chart.js) for the frontend and Razor Pages (.cshtml) letting me mix C# and HTML code. 

I used Asp.Net Core as my framwork but with the MVC structure (Models, Views, Controllers) 

To host a private SQL server for my DB i used the Docker Platform and it communicates with EF Core so there's no need for raw SQL code.
